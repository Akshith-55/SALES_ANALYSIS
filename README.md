# 📊 Superstore Sales Analysis — Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an in-depth analysis of **4 years of Superstore sales data (2015–2018)** using Power BI.  
The dashboard uncovers category performance, regional demand, customer behavior, order trends, product profitability, and shipping preferences to support data-driven business decisions.

## 🧩 Business Problem  
The retail business needs clarity on **where revenue is coming from**, **which areas underperform**, and **how to improve profitability**.  
Key decisions the business wants to make include:

- Which **regions** have the highest potential for growth?  
- How to **increase average order value**?  
- What seasonal trends affect **forecasting and inventory planning**?  
- Which products are **top performers** and which should be **optimized or discontinued**?  
- How customer **shipping preferences** impact satisfaction and logistics?

This dashboard provides insights for leadership to make informed choices on marketing, expansion, pricing, and product strategy.

### 📈 **4. Sales Trends & Yearly Performance**
